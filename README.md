# About

This repository contains the following:
- [implementation](./implementation): PDDL formalization of the domain and problems;
- [paper](./scheer-paper): LaTeX sources of the final paper;
- [planner](./planner): Temporal Planning;
- [proposal](./scheer-proposal): LaTeX sources of the domain proposal;


# Problem addressed

The core idea of this project is to represent a compiler as a PDDL domain. With this approach, a planner could test whether a program can run in parallel or not.


# To do

- [x] Add order to operations;
- [x] Add used planner binaries ([link](https://github.com/claudioscheer/source-code-compiler-pddl/tree/master/planner));
- [ ] Send a pull request to the original planner with the changes;
