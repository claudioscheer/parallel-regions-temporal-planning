# About

This repository contains the following:
- [implementation](./implementation): PDDL formalization of the domain and problems
- [proposal](./scheer-proposal): LaTeX sources of the domain proposal
- [paper](./scheer-paper): LaTeX sources of the final paper


# Problem addressed

The core idea of this project is to represent a C compiler as a PDDL domain. With this approach, a planner could test whether a problem can run in parallel or not.
