# Planner used

I used the Temporal Planning available [here](https://github.com/aig-upf/temporal-planning). The source code was downloaded when the repository was at commit [bd9731c404705ae15ba9476e2b808593819ef813](https://github.com/aig-upf/temporal-planning/tree/bd9731c404705ae15ba9476e2b808593819ef813).


# Changes

To compile Fast Downward, I had to remove `-Werror` at line 17 of the [FastDownwardMacros.cmake](https://github.com/aig-upf/temporal-planning/blob/master/fd_copy/src/cmake_modules/FastDownwardMacros.cmake) file.


# Release

The planner was released [here](https://github.com/claudioscheer/source-code-compiler-pddl/releases/tag/planner).
